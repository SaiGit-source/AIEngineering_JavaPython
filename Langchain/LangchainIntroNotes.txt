What's Langchain?
It's an abstract layer, which helps you to build application on LLMs.
Langchain now has multiple products like Langgraph, Langsmith. Langgraph is mostly for building agents. 2025 is the year of agents.

 Two styles of coding: Imperative and Declarative
 Imperative is you write every line of code by yourself. Do this after this etc
 Declarative --> you specify what you want then the system behind the scenes will do things for you. Example SQL --> if you want to fetch some data from database, you dont specify how to go to Database etc
 Which is better? it depends. 
 LangChain is more Declarative because you specify what you want and it will do things for you

 The advantage of using SpringAI is SpringAI is connected to SpringBoot
 However, when you connect LangChain to FastAPI there could be some issues

 This is LangChain for Java: https://docs.langchain4j.dev/

Next is SpringAI with memory, LangChain with memory
