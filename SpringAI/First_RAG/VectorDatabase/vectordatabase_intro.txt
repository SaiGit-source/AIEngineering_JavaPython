Vector Database
We want to go towards RAG, we want to build up towards that

If AI has to do some generations or classifications for you, then it has to make a sense of the data. that means we have to store words in such a way that they are related. so when you search for something you should be able to find it. thats where Embedding comes into picture.
You take a sentence, you convert them into words then tokens --> tokens to numbers (Embeddings)
Where are we going to store this data/Embeddings?
In normal database, it is ok to store numbers, strings etc
But for AI, we have Embeddings, how to store Embeddings?
thats where we have a special type of database that's the Vector database.
In Vector database, we can not only store Embeddings but also can retrieve in the correct form

Say you want to convert the word "watch" into Embeddings, the result is a Vector
if the dimension is set to 1000 then we will get 1000 numbers, depending on the dimension

According to IBM: https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/vector-database


What is a vector database?
A vector database stores, manages and indexes high-dimensional vector data. Data points are stored as arrays of numbers called “vectors,” which are clustered based on similarity. This design enables low-latency queries, making it ideal for AI applications.

Vector database use cases

The applications for vector databases are vast and growing. Some key use cases include:
    Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
    Conversational AI
    Recommendation engines
    Vector search

Yes Vector database can be used for RAG or Conversational AI

We have Azure Cosmos DB, MariaDB vectorstore, PGVector

For PGVector we got to run on Docker. 

When Oracle bought MySQL, we got a clone of MySQL, which is MariaDB
 
Initially we will start with SimpleVectorStore (https://docs.spring.io/spring-ai/docs/current/api/org/springframework/ai/vectorstore/SimpleVectorStore.html) and use it as InMemory store
