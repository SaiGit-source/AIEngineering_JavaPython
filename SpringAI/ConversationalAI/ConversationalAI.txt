Say you ask "What's Java?"
Then "What's JVM?"
Then "How are they 2 related?"

Other point is formatting the output. When we wanted movie recommendation, we were sending some request and getting some output

We can have some pre-defined stuff and add user-text and you can display data in a particular format
